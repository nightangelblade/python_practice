# Post Bootcamp Week 1 Project: Basic Python

This project was two weeks after graduating from Dev Bootcamp SF Otters 2017. It is my first attempt to play with coding in Python, such as declaring basic objects like variables, integer, floats, arrays, and hashes. As well I'm testing out some basic operations and defining methods/functions in it.
